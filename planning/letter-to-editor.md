# Letter to Editor 

Dear XXX

I am writing with a question about possibly publishing a book on data science in education with YYY.

The book is on data science in education and is written by a team of co-authors working in different roles in education: researchers, administrators, and data analysts. The book aims to speak to individuals working in education about what data science might offer. We think this is important because there does not yet exist a language for what data science means (or what its potential can be) for those involved in education. 

The book has three general sections: 
An overview of what data science in education is and why it is important (i.e., what some of the ways that data science ideas are relevant to education and what challenges are faced by those doing data science in education).
An introduction to a widely-used, freely-available statistical software tool, R, and walkthroughs for how R can be used to achieve data and data analysis-related goals.
A discussion of what to do once one has a foundation in using data science, including tips on how to be strategic about implementing data science and how educators (at the PK-12 and the post-secondary level) can teach others to use data science tools and methods in education.

I hope this is not too much about the book but that my message contains enough information to give you the chance to determine whether this might be something you would be interested in pursuing - or speaking with me and my co-authors more about to gauge your interest.

Thank you for your consideration of this.

Sincerely,
ZZZ
